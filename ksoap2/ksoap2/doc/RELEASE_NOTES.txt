History
=======
2.x.x	2006/??/??	Release
- SF BUG # 1267551 Null pointer exception when providing a KVMSerializable object with a null
namespace.  Added unit test and fixed the problem. (reported by hakkikt). This change
allows KVMSerializable objects to not have to initialize the namespace.
- Refactorings to make the transport layer more configurable and testable.

2.0.2	2006/02/04	Maintenance Release
- Added new targets to the build to produce various  jar releases for different uses.  Provided a new
jar that has just the classes that it needs to run.  This removes the problem some have had while
pre-verifying the classes and receiving an error about a FileReader class not being found.
- Moved the target class file creation from 1.1 to 1.2 to help those building with Java 1.5. SF
BUG:1415810. Thanks to jozart
- Small code formatting cleanup.
- No bug fixes, API changes, or code flow has been modified in this release.
