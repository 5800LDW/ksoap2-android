<h1>kSOAP 2 Concept Test Version</h1>

<ul>
<li>2002-12-07 New version available, several fixes</li>
</ul>

<p>kSOAP 2 is a new version of kSOAP, based on 
<a href="http://kxml.org" target="_top">kXML2</a>. <br />
<b>Please Note:</b> Currently, every implementation detail 
including the kSOAP 2 API may still change significantly. Also,
the version available now has not really been tested</p>

<p>For a stable version of kSOAP, please refer to

<h3>What's different for kSOAP2</h3>

<p>kSOAP 2 is a complete
redesign, taking the lessons learned from kSOAP 1.x into account. 
Unfortunately, this will require some additional effort when porting
code from kSOAP 1 to kSOAP 2. </p>

<p>Some important changes are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Structure cleaned up</li>
<li>kSOAP2 has improved support for literal encoding</li>
<li>SOAP Serialization support is now optional and contained 
  in a separate package</li>
<li>Several separate classes have been integrated into the class
  class SoapSerializationEnvelope, providing 
  SOAP serialization support. SoapSerializationEnvelope extends the
  base class SoapEnvelope. </li>
<li>A dotNet flag can be used to switch the SoapSerializationEnvelope
  from standard behaviour to the namespace handling that seems to be
  default in .NET</li>
</ul>
